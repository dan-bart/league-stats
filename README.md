# league-stats

My dad recently started to bet on various football leagues for fun. To help him make some data-driven decisions, and also test my web-scraping skills, I made this project, which extracts statistics of yellow cards for selected combination of two teams and a referee for year 2020 and later.

*FB_REF.py* scrapes statistics from https://fbref.com/en/ for selected football leagues. Currently only works with Italian Series A, LaLiga and Czech League.

*results.ipynb* presents summary statistics such as the count and mean of yellow cards given in both halves, and a binomial distribution of the number of yellow cards.
